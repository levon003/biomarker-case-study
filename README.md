# Tempus Biomarker Case Study

Modeling with patient biomarker data.

## Summary

The description of the modeling is in the data modeling notebook, located at `notebook/DataModeling.ipynb`.
Visualizations of the raw data, including both figures and tables, are located in the data exploration notebook (`notebook/DataExploration.ipynb`).

## Data

Poetry is used for managing Python dependencies, and will be installed if it isn't already available.
